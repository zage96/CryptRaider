# CryptRaider
3rd project from the course UE5 C++ Developer.
The game consists on a first person game, where the main character is in a dungeon where it has to solve a little puzzle in order to get to a mausoleum, where another puzzle is presented to get a gold statue.
For the development of the game, UE 5.3.2 was used as well as a Medieval Dungeon pack. Using different techniques such as activating and deactivating physics on objects, adding and using tags on objects, certain actions were made. Actions like movement of platforms and trigger zones, allowed the mechanics of the level.
